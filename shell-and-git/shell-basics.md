## Terminal

- It’s a command line interface (CLI)
- We use it to interact with the shell (a program that runs in the terminal)
- Commands:
ls → a command to list files located in the folder I am located in a given time  
``ls -a`` → shows also the hidden files  
``ls -l`` → shows files and longer details  
``ls -la`` → shows hidden files and longer details  
``cd [directory]`` → changes directory to selected directory  
``cd ..`` → navigates back to one directory  
``cd …`` → navigates back to two directories (?)  
``cd ~`` → navigates back to the home  
``cd /`` → navigates to the root  
``cd + [start typing something] + tab`` → starts listing the directories where you can go to  
``cd -`` → navigates back to the last directory you were in  
``pwd`` → print working directory (tells me in which directory I am)  
``touch [file name]`` → creates a file  
``cat`` → allows you to see what’s inside the file (prints the file content)  
``echo [content] > [file name]`` → adds content to file  
``mkdir [directory name]`` → creates a folder  
``mv [file] [folder name]`` → moves file to folder  
``mv [file] ..`` → moves file back one directory   
``mv [file] ../..`` → moves file back two directories  
``mv [file name] [new file name]`` → renames file  
``rm [filename]`` → deletes file  
``rmdir`` → deletes empty directories (?)
